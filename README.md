Library to create plugin for [`komondor`](https://github.com/unional/komondor).

## Usage

To create plugin, you need to export a `activate()` function as follow:

```ts
import { Registrar } from 'komondor-plugin'

export function activate(registrar: Registrar) {
  registrar.register(...)
}
```

The plugin should supply a `getSpy()` and `getStub()` function,
or `getReturnSpy()` and `getReturnStub()` function.

The `Spy` is used to record the actions performed,
while the `Stub` is used to replay the actions recorded.

The `ReturnSpy` and `ReturnStub` is used if the subject that cross the boundary is a return value of some other functions/methods.
For example `Promise` and `Stream`.

This library also provide some helper functions in `registrat.util` for creating plugins.

## API

### createAction(type: string, payload, meta?): SpecAction

A simple helper to create action.

### createScopedCreateAction(actionType): (subType: string, payload, meta?) => SpecAction

Create a scoped `createAction()` for creating sub actions.
You will most likely to use this function to create a class of actions for a specific plugin.

### createExpectation(type: string, meta?): (payload) => SpecExpectation

`SpecExpectation` is a partial `SpecAction` to be used in a the `spec.satisfy()` call.

Use this function to create helper functions for the user to create their expectations easily.

### createScopedCreateExpectation(type: string): (subType: string, meta?) => (payload) => SpecExpectation

Create a scoped `createExpectation()`.

npm run test

# Manually verify the project.
# This will be ran during 'npm preversion' so you normally don't need to run this yourself.
npm run verify

# Build the project.
# You normally don't need to do this.
npm run build

# Run tslint
# You normally don't need to do this as `npm run watch` and `npm version` will automatically run lint for you.
